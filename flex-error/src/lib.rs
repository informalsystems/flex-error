#![no_std]

/*!
`flex-error` is a lightweight Rust library that uses macros and traits
to switch between different error tracing implementations and no_std. The library currently supports 3 modes via Cargo feature flags: `eyre_tracer` (default), `anyhow_tracer`, and `string_tracer` (no_std).

The library separates out several concepts as traits:
`ErrorDetail`, [`ErrorTracer`], and [`ErrorSource`].

  - `ErrorDetail` is responsible to structured metadata information about a specific error.

  - `ErrorTracer` is responsible for tracing error chains and backtraces.

  - `ErrorSource` allows generic conversion of external error types into an ErrorDetail with optional ErrorTrace.

  - An application error is of type
    [`ErrorReport<ErrorDetail, ErrorTracer>`](crate::ErrorReport),
    which holds both the error details and trace.

With the separation of concerns, `flex-error` allows applications to easily
switch between different error reporting implementations,
such as [`eyre`] and [`anyhow`], by implementing
[`ErrorTracer`] for the respective reporters.

`flex-error` defines a [`define_error!`] macro that define custom `Detail`
types and error types as alias to
[`ErrorReport<Detail, DefaultTracer>`](crate::ErrorReport).
The [`DefaultTracer`] type is set globally by the feature flag, so that
application error types do not have to be over-generalized.
The trade off is that it is not possible to use multiple
[`ErrorTracer`] implementations at the same time across different crates that
use `flex-error`.
